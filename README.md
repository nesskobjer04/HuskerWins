  Project Report.pdf:
    The project required us to find a dataset that we found interesting and create some sort of data visualization report based off of it. 
    I'm from Nebraska and am a big Husker football fan so I decided to use this data on Husker football that has information on every game
    since september of 1962. The main purpose of the data investigation and visualization was to strengthen our understanding of predictors
    and regression models. Hence I investigated the biggest factors in my home team winning football games. Read the report for more details.
